# About adsorption of porous materials.
# This is a code that uses Numpy and Pandas to calculate the source file data, build a fitting model, optimize the parameters, and output the coefficients and parameters using Matplotlib. However, if it is converted into curve fitting in Kinetics, the fitting curve can appear accurately, but the determination coefficient is wrong.
